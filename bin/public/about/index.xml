      <description>&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Itâ€™s not that I want to break things. I want to learn how they work.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I am a security researcher with a passion for understanding the structures and mechanisms behind technology. My work is focused on deeply analyzing and learning how systems are built and function, from the ground up. I aim to explore, utilize, and optimize these structures to enhance security and gain a deeper understanding of how technology operates.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
